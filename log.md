# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I Plan to work on my abandoned apointments system (plan make grow in a Clinical Managment System), the status of this project the day I resuming my work in it is: 

  Login flow is working in both backend and frontend, the used stack is a GRAPHQL API, MONGO as DB and Redis for sessions with JWT and frontend is React APP with hooks (I'm trying to avoid classes because I fu%&($! hate them!), first days I plan to focus on tests and continuous integration because currently it has nothing of these.

### Day 0: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**

Resumed my work in the GraphQL Api of my project

- ✔︎ Configured test with mocha, should and nyc for coverage
- ✔︎ First test specs, 
- ✔︎ Configured CircleCI to run the tests
- ✔︎ Configure Codecov to get test coverage reports
  
**Thoughts:** 

Need to configure deploy step in circleci to put this at heroku or similar, the amount of files that are cover by my tests sucks need to add much more tests
