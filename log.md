# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I Plan to work on my abandoned apointments system (plan make grow in a Clinical Managment System), the status of this project the day I resuming my work in it is: 

  Login flow is working in both backend and frontend, the used stack is a GRAPHQL API, MONGO as DB and Redis for sessions with JWT and frontend is React APP with hooks (I'm trying to avoid classes because I fu%&($! hate them!), first days I plan to focus on tests and continuous integration because currently it has nothing of these.
